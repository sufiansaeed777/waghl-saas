# AI Caller Platform MVP - Proposal

---

Sufian here

I read your entire post and I understand you need a real developer who can build production level voice AI systems not just basic automation


**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS FIRST:**

**Estimated time for MVP:** 4-6 weeks

**Estimated cost range:** $4,000 - $7,000 (depends on exact scope we finalize)


Now let me show you why I am the right fit


I am a software developer with 7+ years building production SaaS platforms and I have hands on experience with voice AI systems and LLM integrations


My Experience with Your Exact Tech Stack


**AI / LLM Systems**
I built multiple AI powered applications using openai gpt-4 and claude apis
I worked with prompt engineering, function calling, and context management for production systems
My live project https://smart-chat-finale.vercel.app/ uses advanced LLM integration with streaming responses


**Voice AI Calling (VAPI)**
I integrated VAPI for automated calling systems in a previous project
I set up inbound and outbound call flows with custom voice agents
I configured webhooks for call events, transcription handling, and real-time call control
I understand VAPI's architecture including assistant configuration, phone numbers, and call recording


**Voice Generation (ElevenLabs)**
I used elevenlabs API for voice cloning and custom voice generation
I configured voice settings (stability, clarity, style) for different use cases
I handled voice streaming and audio file generation in production


**Automation / Orchestration (n8n)**
I built complex workflows in n8n for lead management and API orchestration
I created custom nodes and webhooks for third party integrations
I used n8n to connect CRMs, calling systems, and databases


**Backend Development & API Design**
I built REST and webhook based APIs using Next.js, Node.js, and Express
I designed database schemas for call logs, lead pipelines, and analytics
I deployed production systems on Vercel, AWS, and custom VPS
I handled authentication, rate limiting, and error handling for production APIs


What I Will Build for You


**MVP Features:**

1. **AI Caller Engine**
   - Auto dialing system for leads in pipeline
   - Call recording and storage
   - Real-time call transcription
   - Call outcome analysis and tagging
   - Feedback loop for AI improvement

2. **Company Dashboard**
   - Create and configure AI voice agents
   - Set tone of voice and behavior
   - Upload custom scripts and knowledge base
   - View call logs and analytics
   - Manage lead pipelines

3. **Telephony Infrastructure**
   - Phone number provisioning (VAPI or Twilio)
   - Inbound/outbound call handling
   - Call routing and queue management
   - Voicemail detection

4. **AI Configuration System**
   - Voice selection (ElevenLabs integration)
   - Prompt templates and personality settings
   - Custom fields for different industries
   - A/B testing for call scripts

5. **Analytics & Reporting**
   - Call success rates
   - Conversation insights
   - Lead scoring based on call outcomes
   - Export reports


**Tech Stack I Will Use:**

- **Backend:** Next.js 14 (App Router) + Node.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Supabase or Railway)
- **Voice AI:** VAPI for calling infrastructure
- **Voice Gen:** ElevenLabs for custom voices
- **Orchestration:** n8n for workflow automation
- **Deployment:** Vercel (frontend) + VPS (backend services)
- **Storage:** S3 or Cloudflare R2 for call recordings


**Timeline Breakdown (4-6 weeks):**

**Week 1:** Architecture & Setup
- Database schema design
- API structure planning
- VAPI and ElevenLabs integration setup
- Basic authentication and user management

**Week 2:** Core Calling System
- Auto dialer implementation
- VAPI call flow configuration
- Call recording and storage
- Transcription processing

**Week 3:** AI & Analytics
- Call outcome analysis
- Tagging system
- Feedback loop implementation
- Voice agent configuration interface

**Week 4:** Company Dashboard
- Agent creation and management
- Pipeline and lead management
- Call logs and analytics
- Voice customization settings

**Weeks 5-6:** Testing & Refinement
- End to end testing with real calls
- Bug fixes and optimization
- Documentation
- Deployment and handover


**Why This is Production Ready Not a Demo:**

- Real telephony integration with actual phone numbers
- Scalable database design for thousands of calls
- Proper error handling and retry logic
- Webhook reliability and idempotency
- Call cost optimization
- Security best practices (API keys, authentication, data encryption)


**Similar Work:**

I built a whatsapp automation SaaS https://whatsapp.bibotcrm.it/ that handles message automation, webhooks, and CRM integration for multiple companies

I created an AI chat platform https://smart-chat-finale.vercel.app/ with LLM streaming, conversation history, and user management

I integrated payment systems and multi tenant architectures in production SaaS platforms


**What You Get:**

- Production ready MVP deployed and running
- Full source code with clean architecture
- Documentation for setup and deployment
- Call testing and quality assurance
- 2 weeks post launch support for bug fixes


**My Availability:**

I can start immediately and work 30-35 hours per week dedicated to this project

I will provide daily updates on progress and weekly demo calls to review features


**Language:**

I can communicate in English fluently and I have basic Italian knowledge (I worked with Italian clients before)


**Next Steps:**

If this fits your vision we can schedule a call to discuss
- Exact feature priorities for MVP
- Specific industries or use cases you are targeting
- Any existing infrastructure or integrations
- Finalize timeline and budget


I am a real developer who writes production code not demos

I understand voice AI systems deeply and I can build this platform end to end


Looking forward to building this with you
