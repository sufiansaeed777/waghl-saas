I read your full post and I understand you need a real developer who can build production level voice AI systems not just automation


**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**

**Estimated time for MVP:** 4-6 weeks

**Estimated cost range:** $4,000 - $7,000


**Why I am the right fit**

I am a software developer with 7+ years building production SaaS and I have real hands on experience with voice AI calling systems


**My Experience with Your Stack:**

**VAPI / Voice AI Calling**
I integrated VAPI for automated calling in previous projects
Set up inbound/outbound flows, webhooks, call recording, real-time transcription
I understand VAPI architecture including assistant config and phone number management

**ElevenLabs**
Used elevenlabs API for voice cloning and custom voice generation
Configured voice settings for different tones and use cases
Handled voice streaming in production

**n8n Automation**
Built complex workflows for lead management and API orchestration
Created webhooks and integrations between CRMs, calling systems, databases

**AI / LLM Systems**
Built AI powered apps using openai and claude APIs
My live project https://smart-chat-finale.vercel.app/ has advanced LLM integration with streaming

**Backend & APIs**
Built production APIs with Next.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL
Deployed on Vercel and VPS with proper auth, rate limiting, error handling


**What I Will Build:**

**Core Features:**
- Auto dialer for pipeline leads with VAPI integration
- Call recording, transcription, and storage
- Call outcome analysis and tagging system
- AI feedback loop for continuous improvement
- Company dashboard to create and configure AI agents
- Voice customization (tone, behavior, scripts)
- Phone number provisioning fully handled
- Analytics and call logs

**Tech Stack:**
Backend: Next.js + Node.js + PostgreSQL
Voice: VAPI + ElevenLabs
Automation: n8n workflows
Deployment: Vercel + VPS for services


**Timeline (4-6 weeks):**

Week 1-2: Core calling system (VAPI integration, auto dialer, recording)
Week 3-4: AI analysis, tagging, company dashboard, agent config
Week 5-6: Testing, optimization, deployment


**Why This is Production Ready:**

Real telephony with actual phone numbers
Scalable database for thousands of calls
Proper error handling and webhook reliability
Security best practices
Not a demo


**Similar Work:**

https://whatsapp.bibotcrm.it/ - automation SaaS with webhooks and CRM integration
https://smart-chat-finale.vercel.app/ - AI chat with LLM streaming and user management


**What You Get:**

Production MVP deployed and running
Clean source code and documentation
2 weeks post launch support


**Availability:**

I can start immediately
30-35 hours per week dedicated
Daily updates and weekly demo calls


**Language:**

Fluent English, basic Italian (worked with Italian clients)


I am a real developer who builds production systems end to end

Looking forward to building this
