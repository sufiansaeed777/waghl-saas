# AI Mentor Coach - Tiered Proposal
**For: Mr. Thomas Aragones – AI Coach for Mental Toughness**
**Prepared by: Sufian Saeed**
**Date: January 30, 2025**

## 1. Project Overview

The goal is to turn your proprietary Mental Toughness & Psychological Flexibility playbook into an interactive AI Mentor Coach that:
- Reflects your coaching philosophy and methodology
- Offers guided, personalized support rather than simple Q&A
- Helps users reflect, grow, and apply the concepts in real life
- Stays fully aligned with your playbook's principles and boundaries

What follows is a set of tiered options so you can choose the level of sophistication and investment that best fits your current roadmap.
