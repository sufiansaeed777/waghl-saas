Sufian here

I am a full stack developer with 7+ years experience and I use Claude Code and Cursor daily for building production apps

I am not an agency and I work independently


**Why I am the right fit**


**AI-Native Development (This is How I Work)**

I use Claude Code every single day for my projects
I also work with Cursor and GitHub Copilot regularly
I understand when AI tools give bad suggestions and I know how to fix them
I use AI as a force multiplier not as a replacement for thinking
I can debug AI generated code when it breaks and refactor it properly


**Full Stack Experience (7+ years)**

**Frontend:**
React and Next.js 14 (app router) - built multiple production SaaS apps
TypeScript for type safety
Tailwind CSS for styling

**Backend:**
Node.js and Python for APIs and automation
REST APIs and webhook handling
Database design (PostgreSQL, Supabase)

**Live Projects:**
https://smart-chat-finale.vercel.app/ - AI chat app (Next.js + OpenAI + Vercel)
https://whatsapp.bibotcrm.it/ - WhatsApp automation SaaS (Node.js + webhooks)
https://www.tradehat.com/ - Trading analysis platform


**What I Can Do for You**

Build and ship features fast using AI tools without compromising quality
Maintain existing messy codebases and improve them incrementally (I dont rewrite everything from scratch)
Debug issues in AI generated code and fix edge cases
Integrate APIs and connect systems (Stripe, OpenAI, Supabase, webhooks)
Build automations that actually work in production
Write clean maintainable code with proper documentation


**Bonus Skills I Have**

**n8n automation** - I built complex workflows for CRM integration and lead management
**Supabase + PostgreSQL** - used in multiple projects for auth and database
**Built SaaS products** - multiple live SaaS apps with subscriptions and payments
**Work independently** - I dont need detailed specs, I ask the right questions and ship features


**My Working Style**

I communicate clearly in written English (all async)
I work 15-20 hours per week consistently
I give daily updates on progress
I ask questions when things are unclear instead of guessing
I understand business goals not just technical requirements
I ship working code not perfect code


**Experience with Messy Codebases**

I worked on existing projects where
Previous developer left incomplete code
AI generated code had bugs and edge cases
No documentation existed
Database schema was not optimized

I fixed these by
Reading the codebase carefully first
Making small incremental improvements
Adding tests for critical flows
Documenting as I go


**When AI Tools Are Wrong (And I Know It)**

AI suggests overly complex solutions when simple ones work
AI generates code without proper error handling
AI doesnt understand business logic context
AI creates security vulnerabilities

I catch these because I review all AI suggestions before using them


**Availability**

I can start immediately
15-20 hours per week dedicated
Flexible with timezones
Available for calls when needed


**What You Get**

A developer who ships features fast using AI tools
Someone who can maintain and fix existing code
Clear async communication
Independent work without hand holding
Production quality code


I use AI tools the right way to build faster not to avoid thinking

Looking forward to working with you
